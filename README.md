### Overview

The Hurton project is a replica of a shopping website for snowboarders. It allows users to shop for new jackets, boots, bindings, and other snowboarding gear with or without creating an account. Account creation does open up additional features such as reviewing items, adding items to a wishlist, and saving account information for easy checkout.
